# Archives 

**Archive :** is the basic structure used to store information 

**Directory :** is where we store the archives , or we can say that the directory is the container of archives

***
# Rules to Respect

- In Linux we should respect the format and the name of file or directory , i mean respecting upper case and lower case ( mayúsculas y minúsculas ) , For exmaple we did create a file called **Cisco.txt** and then i did create another one called **cisco.txt** to replace the first one , so Linux does not replace the second file by the first file because he detect that they are different's
 
  - The file name in linux cannot exceed 255 characters
 
  - The name of a file can use any character, except */* ( slash ) , Although it is not recommended to use:
    
**= \ ~ (tilt) “ * # ; - ? [] () ! & <> |** ,  we can use them in the file name but it's not recommendable

# Types of Archives

- **Ordinary files (-)**: They contain text, images, pdf, etc.

- **Directories (d)**: Contain other files.

- **Devices**: They represent devices.
**(c)**: Character devices. Example: **Printer**
**(b)**: Block devices. Example: **Hard drive**

 - **Links (l)**: They represent access to other files.
