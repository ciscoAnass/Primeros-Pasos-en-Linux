  # Scripts


First let's talk about some rules that we have to respect :

1-**#!/bin/bash** : we should always put it in every first line of a script file

2-**.sh** : The script file should always done with **.sh**

3-To execute the Script file we use this command : 
>sh fichero1.sh

## Let's create our first basic Script

- We can see in the picture that we did create a script file and we did put **#!/bin/bash** int eh first line and in the second line i put a comment (author) of the file which is optional , u can put it or no and finally we did put **echo "Hello world"** which mean print hello word so when we execute the script , we get Hello World as the result of execution .
